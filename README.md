# Advanced Opencart Reviews

## Features

### **Privacy Policy**
Advanced Reviews allows you to assign a privacy policy to the review form which needs to be confirmed by the customer.

### **Verified reviews**
Since May 25th, shops in Europe need to display if a review is based on a verified purchase or not. In addtion, shops need to inform the customer how a review becomes a verified one. To match this rule you can select a custom text which will be displayed on the review tab.

### **Advanced review user interface**
Advanced Reviews replaces the boring looking form and table of reviews in your store with a custom implementation.

### **Multi language support**
This extension supports both English and German out of the box. Adding another language is as simple as copying two files and exchange it's content.

### **Mutli theme support**
The default theme, Sellegance and Amino are supported out of the box. When the review tab in your theme is implemented like the review tab in the default theme, it will work without any modifications. Otherwise, small adjustments may be required.

### **Additional features**
This extension contains more minor features. For example you can cut of the name of the custome rin the review. For example when a customer enters his name like this: Marvin Klein, the extension can display it as Marvin K.

You can also specify whether or not the customer must also enter their email address when submitting a review. This is useful, for example, if you want to contact the customer based on their review to resolve any problems.

## Requirements
This extension requires at least Opencart 3.0.3.8. It might work in older version of Opencart 3 but we have not tested it with any older version.

Right now this extension is only available as a VqMod extension. 

## How to install
Simply copy all content from admin, catalog and vqmod to your server. No core files will be overwritten. 

Once the files are copied make sure that you have the permission to edit and view this extension. To set the permissions go to your Administration->System->Users->User-> User Groups->[SELECT YOUR GROUP] and enable both view and edit permission for **extension/module/advanced_reviews**

Next navigate to Extensions->Extensions and press on install for Advanced Reviews. The only thing left todo is to configure the extension.
