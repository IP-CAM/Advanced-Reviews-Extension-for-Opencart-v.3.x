## Requirements
This extension requires at least Opencart 3.0.3.8. It might work in older version of Opencart 3 but we have not tested it with any older version.

Right now this extension is only available as a VqMod extension. 

## How to install
Simply copy all content from admin, catalog and vqmod to your server. No core files will be overwritten. 

Once the files are copied make sure that you have the permission to edit and view this extension. To set the permissions go to your Administration->System->Users->User-> User Groups->[SELECT YOUR GROUP] and enable both view and edit permission for **extension/module/advanced_reviews**

Next navigate to Extensions->Extensions and press on install for Advanced Reviews. The only thing left todo is to configure the extension.

## Roadmap
1. Implementing image upload for product reviews
2. Add OCMOD varient
